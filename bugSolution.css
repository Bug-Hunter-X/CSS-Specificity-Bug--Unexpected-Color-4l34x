The solution involves using more specific selectors to correctly apply the intended styles.

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.my-class {
  color: red;
}

.my-class > div {
  color: green; /* More specific selector using the child combinator */
}
```

By using the `>` child combinator in the `.my-class > div` selector, we explicitly target the direct child `div` elements of the `.my-class` element. This makes the rule more specific than `.my-class`'s `color: red`, resulting in the desired green color for the text.  Alternatively, increasing specificity through additional classes or IDs on the inner div would also solve the issue.
