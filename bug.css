The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.my-class {
  color: red;
}

.my-class div {
  color: green;
}

```

This looks straightforward, but consider the element structure below:

```html
<div class="my-class">
  <div>This text should be green.</div>
</div>
```

Intuitively, one might expect "This text should be green" to display in green, given the specificity of the `.my-class div` selector. However, due to how specificity works in CSS, the text will actually be red. This is because the `div` selector with `class="my-class" ` is more specific than `.my-class div`, so it overrides the more nested rule. The order of the rules does not affect the outcome, only the specificity.

This is an uncommon bug because it highlights a counter-intuitive aspect of CSS specificity that often leads to unexpected visual outcomes, even for experienced developers.
